I may or may not start this blog.

The intention would be to write about stuff I came up with or stuff that the Google couldn't explain the way would have liked.

Anyway I have to check that I can show beatifoul math, because math needs to be beautifoul to be digested:


\\[ 1 + 1 = 3 \\]
\\( 1 + 1 = 3 \\)
$$ 1 + 1 = 3 $$
