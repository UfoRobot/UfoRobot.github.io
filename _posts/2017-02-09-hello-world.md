I may or may not start this blog.

The intention would be to write about stuff I came up with or stuff that the Google couldn't explain the way would have liked.

Anyway I have to check that I can show pretty math, because math needs to be pretty on the eye to be digested. Some random equations:

\\[ 1 + 1 = 3 \\]

and an inline statement such as \\(\\pi = 3.14\\)
